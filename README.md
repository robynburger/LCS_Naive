## Description of LCS

LCS, or longest consecutive subsequence, aims toFor a string of characters, nonconsec_cubic identifies the longest subsequence 
repeated three times. It finds the optimal breakpoints to seperate the string 
into three consecutive substrings, each containing the subsequence. It then 
returns these indices and three matrices, F, D, and E.
